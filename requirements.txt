# requirements.txt

# Core
PyYAML>=6.0
sounddevice>=0.4.6
numpy>=1.26.0,<2.0 # Let's start below 2.0 for safety, pip might upgrade if needed/possible
scipy>=1.10.0
requests>=2.30.0

# STT (Speech-to-Text - Faster Whisper)
faster-whisper>=1.0.0
# Dependencies for faster-whisper:
ctranslate2>=4.0.0 # Check compatibility with your CUDA/cuDNN (See faster-whisper docs)
huggingface_hub>=0.13
tokenizers>=0.13,<1
# onnxruntime is listed below (shared dependency)
PyAV>=11.0.0 # Replaces ffmpeg requirement
tqdm # For progress bars during model download

# Hotword Detection (OpenWakeWord)
openwakeword>=0.5.0
# Dependencies for openwakeword:
# onnxruntime is listed below (shared dependency)
# numpy is listed above
# scipy is listed above
protobuf>=3.20.0,<5.0.0 # Common ONNX dependency, pin below 5 for safety
sounddevice # Already listed above

# Shared Dependencies
onnxruntime-gpu>=1.17.0 # Use GPU version. Ensure version matches CUDA/cuDNN needs. Check ONNX Runtime docs.

# VAD (Voice Activity Detection)
webrtcvad-wheels>=2.0.10.post2 # Keep for recording control

# Console UI
rich>=13.7.0

# TTS Audio Decoding (SNAC)
# Assuming 'snac' is installed separately, e.g., from a specific source/repo
# If it's on PyPI:
# snac>=[version]
# torch is required by snac
torch>=2.0.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 # Example for CUDA 12.1, adjust for your 12.8

# NOTE: Adjust torch install URL based on your exact CUDA version (e.g., cu118, cu121, cpu)
# NOTE: For onnxruntime-gpu, ensure your CUDA and cuDNN versions are compatible.
# NOTE: For ctranslate2, ensure your CUDA and cuDNN versions are compatible (CUDA 12/cuDNN 9 preferred for latest). Check faster-whisper/CTranslate2 docs. May need pinning like: ctranslate2==3.24.0 for CUDA 11
# NOTE: Ensure the 'snac' library is installed according to its specific instructions.
# NOTE: Starting numpy below 2.0 for initial safety, pip's resolver might adjust this.
